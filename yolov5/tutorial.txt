./yolov5_det -s yolov5s.wts yolov5s.engine s
    -s: Indicates that you want to serialize the model.
    yolov5s.wts: Path to the weights file generated from the PyTorch model.
    yolov5s.engine: Desired name for the TensorRT plan file.
    s: Indicates the YOLOv5 model size (choose one of n/s/m/l/x/n6/s6/m6/l6/x6).

./yolov5_det -d yolov5s.engine /home/quandang246/project/tensorrtx/yolov5/images
    -d: Indicates that you want to deserialize the model and run inference.
    yolov5s.engine: Path to the serialized TensorRT plan file (replace with the actual path to your .engine file).
    /path/to/image_folder: Path to the folder containing the images you want to process.
